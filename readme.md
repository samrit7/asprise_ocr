## Installation ü•∞

To incorporate the OCR module into your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Copy the contents of the OCR module into your project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
   npm i asprise_ocr_request
   npm i request
    ```

4. Configure the OCR module by setting the necessary environment variables (see [config.js](#configjs)).

## Usage ü•≥

To utilize the OCR module for text extraction, follow these steps:

1. Import the OCR module in your code:

    ```javascript
    import { compare } from './ocr';
    ```

2. Call the `compare` function, passing the image file as an argument. The `file` variable is expected to be an object with the following properties:

    - `buffer`: A Buffer containing the raw binary data of the file.
    - `originalname`: The original name of the file as provided by the client when uploading.

    ```javascript
    const file = /* Your image file object */;
    
    try {
      const ocrResults = await compare(file);
      console.log('OCR Results:', ocrResults);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('OCR Error:', error);
    }
    ```
